    The [_Eldar Leadership_](#eldar-leadership), [_Eldar Movement_](#eldar-movement), [_Eldar Critical Hits_](#eldar-critical-hits) rules apply to all Eldar vessels. Eldar ships are armed with _Eldar Weapons_ (see [_Eldar Weapons_](#eldar-weapons)) and use _Eldar Holofields_ (see [_Eldar Holofields_](#eldar-holofields)) for protection rather than shields. Certain ships carry [_Aspect Warrior Fighting Crews_](#aspect-warrior-crews). Iyanden Craftworld ghostships use the [_Ghostships_](#eldar-ghostships) special rules.
