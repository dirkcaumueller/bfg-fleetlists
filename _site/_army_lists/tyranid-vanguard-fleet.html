    The fleet list includes the following information:

    Class
    : The type of the ship.

    Notes
    : Notes on usage or optional upgrades.

    Cost
    : The points value of the formation.
special_rules_text:

    The [_Synaptic Control_](#synaptic-control) and [_Tyranid Xenobiology_](#tyranid-xenobiology) rules apply to all Tyranid vessels. Tyranid ships are armed with [_Tyranid Bioweaponry_](#tyranid-weaponry) and use [_Spores_](#spores) for protection rather than shields and turrsts.
    
    Tyranids do not follow the normal squadron rules when forming up the fleet. Vanguard drone ships and Kraken may be deployed in squadrons of 6 to 12 models. You may combine the two types in a single squadron if you wish.

<p>Tyranids have an attack rating of 3.</p>

Escort squadrons in a Tyranid Vanguard fleet may take a Leadership test at the start of each turn in order to override their Instinctive Behaviour, just as if they were in range of a hive ship. Each squadron uses their own Leadership for the test (you canâ€™t use that of a nearby ship or squadron) and if failed, uses Instinctive Behaviour as normal.

You may test to override Instinctive Behaviour for all your squadrons even if a squadron fails.
