    May not *Come To New Heading*. **Mark of Slaanesh** included in cost and may never have other Marks of Chaos. Must always be fleet flagship and carry Warmaster, unless a Planet Killer is present. Cannot be used in any fleet that has World Eaters Chaos Space Marines or any vessels bearing the Mark of Khorne unless the fleet is being led by Abbadon the Despoiler. **Palace of Pleasure**: This ship always counts as being crewed by Emperor’s Children Chaos Space Marines (included it its cost).
