notes:
  |
    Initially Ld 9, drops 1 Ld per point of damage down to Ld 5. _Bridge Smashed_ critical effect does not change Ld but causes +1 damage. Worth 300 VP in a pure Demiurg fleet or when fighting Orks. May not _Come to New Heading_. Launch bays may launch assault craft **or** torpedoes each turn - not both.
