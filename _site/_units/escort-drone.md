notes:
  |
    Must purchase one weapon at the costs in the fleet list. Escort drones subject to Instinctive Behaviour case 7 (‘must move towards a planet’) may instead move towards the nearest hive ship. Any ship attempting to fire upon a hive ship suffers -1 Ld when attempting to ignore closer targets if a squadron containing only Escort Drones is in base contact with the hive ship as well as in between the hive ship and the firing vessel.
