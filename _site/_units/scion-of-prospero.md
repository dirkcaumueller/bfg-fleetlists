notes:
  |
    May not *Come To New Heading*. **Mark of Tzeentch** included in cost and may never have other Marks of Chaos. Must always be fleet flagship and carry Warmaster, unless a Planet Killer is present. Cannot be used in any fleet that has Death Guard Chaos Space Marines or any vessels bearing the Mark of Nurgle unless the fleet is being led by Abbadon the Despoiler. **Vortex of Chaos**: At the end of each movement phase, any ship within 15cm of this vessel (friend or foe!) must place a blast marker in base contact with it. **Vagaries of Fate**: gains an extra +1 ship-only re-roll in addition to that from the Mark of Tzeentch, but takes 1HP damage if a re-roll fails for any reason.
