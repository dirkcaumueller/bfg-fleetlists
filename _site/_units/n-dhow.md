    Tau ships with gravitic hooks may bring Dhows instead of Orcas (but may not bring a mix of both). Dhows use the leadership of their parent capital ship +1 (representing their natural spacefaring ability) for all leadership tests. Dhows may only squadron with other Dhows carried by parent capital ships that are themselves in the same squadron.
