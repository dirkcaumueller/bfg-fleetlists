notes:
  |
    May not *Come To New Heading*. **Mark of Nurgle** included in cost (and extra hit included in statline) and may never have other Marks of Chaos. Must always be fleet flagship and carry Warmaster, unless a Planet Killer is present. Cannot be used in any fleet that has Thousand Sons Chaos Space Marines or any vessels bearing the Mark of Tzeentch unless the fleet is being led by Abbadon the Despoiler. **Miasma of Pestilence**: Replaces the ship’s turrets and works in exactly the same way as turrets against attack craft but has no effect against torpedoes. **Hives of Nurgle**: The Hives of Nurgle function in exactly the same way as weapons batteries. The Nurgle player may also place a single Blast marker anywhere along the Terminus Est's course after each move to represent the constant  seeping from these hives. It also obscures and distorts the shape of the Terminus Est, meaning that vessels within 15 cm do not benefit from a left column shift when firing at it.
