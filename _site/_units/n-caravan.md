    +1 Ld (max 10). Cannot take Burn Retros, Come To New Heading or All Ahead Full special orders. A Nicassar Caravan moves 10 cm in any direction during the movement phase, no more, no less. It is not slowed down by blast markers, celestial phenomena or being crippled. Does not take normal critical effects: critical hits simply cause +1 hit.
