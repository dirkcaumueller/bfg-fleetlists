notes:
  |
    May not *Come To New Heading*. **Mark of Khorne** included in cost and may never have other Marks of Chaos. If not the flagship, must have a Chaos Lord.  **Berzerker Horde**: embarks Chaos Space Marines with the Mark of Khorne, with a boarding modifier of +2 in addition to its improved boarding value. Chosen Terminators: may roll 2D6 and pick the highest D6 when conducting a Hit and Run attack each turn. **Chariot of Slaughter**: Does not have to be used as the fleet’s flagship unless it is the most expensive vessel present. Cannot be used in any fleet that has Emperor’s Children Chaos Space Marines or any vessels bearing the Mark of Slaanesh unless the fleet is being led by Abaddon the Despoiler.
