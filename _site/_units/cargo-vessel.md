notes:
  |
     Moves +4D6 when under _All Ahead Full_ special orders as warships do. Worth one assault point in planetary assault scenarios when within 30 cm of the planet edge and count as a half-transport (rounding DOWN) in scenarios that require transports. When included in a Rogue Trader escort squadron and not being used as a transport, offers +1 Ld to _Reload Ordnance_ for the squadron (regardless of the number of Cargo Vessels present).
