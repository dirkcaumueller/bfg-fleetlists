notes:
  |
    Must purchase one weapon at the costs in the fleet list. Kraken have no spore cysts but count as always being on Brace for Impact special orders when they take damage, receiving a 4+ save against each hit sustained, including those sustained when rolling a 6 for moving through blast markers. This ability in no way affects the Kraken and they may use other special orders as normal.
