name: Eldar Holofields
---
Against attacks that use the Gunnery table, the holofields cause one column shift to the right, in addition to any other column shifts for range or Blast markers. Against any other form of attack (lances, torpedoes, etc), roll to hit an Eldar ship as normal, but the Eldar player may then make a saving roll for his holofields.

|D6 | RESULT|
--- | ---
|1|Hit! Score a hit on the Eldar ship.|
|2+|Missed! Place a Blast marker in contact with the ship.|

Note that holofields do not negate hits or effects from moving through blast markers, area effects, exploding ships and celestial phenomena. They do, however, work against ordnance hits, hit-and-run raids, boarding actions, ramming or Nova Cannon. When saving against Nova Cannon, it rolls once against the hit itself, not the subsequent D6 damage rolls if the save fails.
