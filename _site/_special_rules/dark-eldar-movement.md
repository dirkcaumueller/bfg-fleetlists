name: Dark Eldar Movement
---
Dark Eldar ships do not need to pass a Command check in order to use *Come to New Heading* special orders and count as automatically passing any Command check to do so. In addition, Dark Eldar cruisers have no minimum required movement, even before turning, but are unable to use the *Burn Retros* special order. Note: All Eldar ships still fall under the restriction that if a ship moves less than 5 cm it counts as a defence for shooting purposes.
