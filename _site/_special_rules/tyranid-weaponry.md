name: Tyranid Weaponry

Pyro-acidic Batteries
: Pyro-acidic battery fire is worked out in the same way as an ordinary weapon battery fire. Ships which suffera critical hit from a pyro-acid weapon automatically receive an additional fire critical result as well (it’s not actually a fire, but the long-term effect is comparable). Pyro-acid batteries are affected by special orders and crippling just like ordinary weapon batteries.

Bio-plasma
: Bio-plasma is treated like a lance shot – roll one dice per point of Strength, hitting on a 4+ regardless of armour. Because it is a relatively slow moving attack, bio-plasma ignores shields and is limited in range to 15 cm.
Bio-plasma is affected by special orders and crippling just like ordinary lance batteries. Bio-plasma does not ignore holofields or reactive hull saves.

Feeder Tentacles
: Many Tyranid ships have huge tentacles which can punch through the hull of a ship allowing the Tyranid organisms inside to assault the enemy. When the ship moves into contact with an enemy ship, it attacks with its feeder tentacles. 
Roll a D6. On a score of 1, 2 or 3 it makes this many Hit-&-Run attacks on the target. On a score of 4+, deal one point of damage on the ship (which may cause critical damage as normal) and additionally make one Hit-&-Run raid. The Tyranid ship can continue moving after making the feeder tentacle attack and shoot or launch ordnance later in the turn, but may only attack one ship with feeder tentacles per turn. 

Feeder tentacles are unaffected by special orders of any kind. If a bio-ship becomes crippled, its feeder tentacles may no longer attack. Feeder tentacles may not attack a ship that made contact during the opponents turn. A Tyranid ship beginning its turn in contact with an enemy ship may make feeder tentacle attacks before continuing its move, as normal.

Massive Claws
: When a Tyranid ship armed with Massive Claws moves into base contact with an enemy, roll 2D6 for each pair of massive claws. Each roll of a 4+ inflicts one hit on the target, ignoring shields but not holofields. A Tyranid ship may only attack a single target with its claws per turn.

If the target is hit by claws only 0 or 1 times, the Tyranid ship can continue moving after making the attack and shoot/launch ordnance later in the turn. If the target is hit by two or more attacks, then the Tyranid vessel has grabbed the target and will not let go until either it or its prey is destroyed. Neither vessel can move if they are of the same class or smaller, while a larger class vessel may still move but only at half rate. 

The sizes for the purposes of continuing movement while grabbed by Massive Claws are exactly the same as ramming, so from biggest to smallest:
Defence > Battleship > Cruiser > Escort
For example, a battleship with a bunch of

If a ship is grabbed by Massive Claws it cannot attempt to disengage until free of them. Both ships may shoot at half effectiveness (nova cannon and similar special weapons cannot fire). Either ship may conduct boarding actions as normal. 
In every End phase roll to attack again. Additionally, if any two attacks hit when a vessel is already grappled then it takes a third additional hit. Massive Claw attacks can cause critical hits as normal. Massive Claws are unaffected by special orders of any kind. If a bio-ship becomes crippled its Massive Claws may no longer attack.
Massive Claws may not attack a ship that made contact during the opponents turn. However, the Tyranid player can elect in its own turn to immediately attack vessels in base contact with Massive claws instead of moving normally.

Ordnance
: Tyranids may only launch boarding torpedoes, fighters, and assault boats (or rather their biological equivalents). It is also possible for the Tyranid fleet to contain ordnance independently of launch bay equipped vessels. For reference, the ordnance speeds are as follows:

| Attack Craft | Speed |
| --- | --- |
| Fighters | 20cm | 
| Assault Boats | 15cm |
| Boarding Torpedoes | 15cm |

Ordnance Limits
: Tyranid bio-ships may have up to twice the number of attack craft markers in play as they have available launch bays. However, if a bio-ship becomes crippled its generative capacities will be turned completely to self preservation and it may no longer launch ordnance.
