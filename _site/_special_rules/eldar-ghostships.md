name: Eldar Ghostships

Any vessel in an Iyanden fleet may be converted into a Ghostship. Ghostships use the following rules:

Leadership
: Ghostships have normal Eldar leadership.

Special Orders
: If a Ghostship fails a Command check for a special order, it not only fails to go onto the special order but may also do nothing except move this turn. If the failed check is as a result of attempting to go onto Brace for Impact orders at another point during the turn, the Ghostship may still attempt to Brace for Impact but may do nothing except move during its next turn instead. When you fail a Command check for a Ghostship you may not make any further Command checks for other Ghostships during the same turn. You may, however, continue to give special orders to other "crewed" vessels in the fleet (until, of course, you fail a Command check with one of them as well).

Deathless
: By the normal fragile standards of the Eldar, Ghostships present a fairly sturdy proposition. Ghostships, unlike other Eldar vessels, only suffer a critical hit on a roll of a 6 (not a 4, 5 or 6 as is usually the case with Eldar vessels).

Uncrewed
: Since Ghostships are piloted by the spirits of long-dead Eldar warriors, their crews are either small or non-existent. For this reason:
* Ghostships may not contain Aspect Warrior fighting crews.
* Ghostships may not be armed with launch bays.
* Ghostships may not initiate boarding actions or hit-and-run attacks of any form.
* Enemies boarding a Ghostship gain a +1 modifier in the boarding action, in addition to other modifiers.
* Enemies making a hit-and-run attack against Ghostships add +1 to their dice roll.

Ghostships roll only half the normal number of dice when undertaking damage control in the End phase (before halving it again for Blast markers, if appropriate).
