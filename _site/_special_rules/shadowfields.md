name: Shadowfields 
--- 
Dark Eldar ships are not protected by the vast energy shields which surround the vessels of other races, but rather employ the form- altering shadowfields. Against attacks that use the Gunnery table, the shadowfields cause one column shift to the right, in addition to any other column shifts for range or Blast markers. Against any other form of attack (ALL strength-based weapons, Nova Cannon shots, any ordnance attacks and any kind of hit and run attacks, ramming and boarding), roll to hit an Dark Eldar ship as normal, but the Dark Eldar player may then make a saving roll for his shadowfields:

|D6 | ROLL RESULT|
|---|---|
|1 | Hit! Score a hit on the Dark Eldar ship.|
|2+ | Missed! Place a Blast marker in contact with the ship.|

Note: Shadowfields do not negate hits from moving through blast markers, exploding ships and celestial phenomena. They do, however, work against ordnance hits, hit- and-run raids, boarding actions, teleport attacks, ramming or nova cannon. 

Against ramming and boarding, they save once against the ramming or boarding attempt, NOT against any damage suffered if this save fails. They do NOT protect against hits caused by celestial phenomena nor any area effects such as Warp Drive implosions, Necron Nightmare Fields, Chaos Marks of Slaanesh, etc. 

Shadowfields save against the shell hit of the nova cannon, not the subsequent damage rolls. For example, if an Dark Eldar vessel is hit and fails to save, it must immediately take as many hits as the damage roll allocates unless it successfully braced beforehand. 

Dark Eldar must determine if they wish to brace against damage they may face BEFORE rolling their shadowfield save. This includes damage from scatter weapons such as Nova Cannon fire. 

When protecting against damage (except against weapons that use the gunnery table), shadowfields roll its save once against each successful attack, whether it be from lance fire, ordnance hits, etc. In other words, its rolls once against a ramming attack, once against each Nova Cannon shot, and once against each hit imparted by ordnance attacks, Hit and Run attacks, etc.
