name: Kroot Warsphere 
--- 
Kroot Warspheres use the following the special rules:

Movement
: Because of their unique construction, Kroot Warspheres don’t move in the same way as normal ships. In their movement phase Warspheres travel 10 cm forward in a straight line, no more, no less. Warspheres may not turn or use Burn Retros or Come To New Heading orders.

On _All Ahead Full_ orders Warspheres move an extra 2D6 cm in any direction at the end of their move. If this causes them to move 10 cm or more, the direction of this additional move becomes their new direction of travel. Due to their low speed and considerable momentum, Warspheres which are crippled or moving through Blast markers do not reduce their speed. Warspheres in the gravity well of a planet or moon may make free turns like an ordinary ship (45°) and/or place themselves in a stationary or low orbit.

Critical Hits
: Warspheres lack the complex systems of true space craft, so critical hits are not rolled on the Critical table. Instead each critical hit inflicts +1 point of damage.

Catastrophic Damage
: When a Warsphere is reduced to 0 damage it breaks up. Don’t roll for Catastrophic damage, instead the Warsphere is replaced by 4 blast markers.

Boarding and Planetary Assaults
: The Warsphere has a boarding strength equal to double its remaining hit points.
During planetary assaults, Kroot Warspheres cannot return to flight during a battle once they have landed. However, they are not destroyed and only count as disengaged for purposes of victory points.

In a planetary assault mission a warsphere will contribute 3 points for each turn it is actually landed on the target planet. It contributes nothing for being within 30 cm.
