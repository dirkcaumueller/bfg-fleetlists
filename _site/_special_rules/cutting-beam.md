name: Cutting Beam
---
The cutting beam is a short ranged but devastating ionisation beam usually employed for gouging out recalcitrant moonlets. The cutting beam counts as a single lance but each Blast marker picked up by the Demiurg vessel in the Movement phase gives the beam the equivalent of one extra lance shot (up to a maximum of 8).

The cutting beam always starts with an effective strength of one before adding for blast markers, and it will never have less than this as long as it is operational.

Any Demiurg vessel may extend the range of its cutting beam to 30 cm by halving its effective strength, rounding down. For example, a Demiurg Bastion that gathers up four blast markers in the course of its immediately previous movement may in the shooting phase fire a Str-5, range 15 cm cutting beam or a Str-2, range 30 cm cutting beam.
Blast markers cannot be held from turn to turn in order to power the cutting beam, any unused ones are lost.
