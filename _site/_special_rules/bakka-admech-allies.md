name: Adeptus Mechanicus Allies

Cruisers from the Adeptus Mechanicus fleet list may be taken instead of and in the same manner as Imperial Navy battlecruisers, counting as battlecruisers against any fleet limits in all respects. They utilize all rules for Adeptus Mechanicus vessels except as follows: they do not count as reserves, they will not disengage when crippled and they may use fleet commander re-rolls.

The fleet may not be led by nor take an Archmagos when used this way.
