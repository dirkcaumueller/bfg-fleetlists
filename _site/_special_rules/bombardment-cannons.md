Space Marine battle barges carry a heavyweight battery of bombardment cannons as part of their main armament. Bombardment cannons fire in the same way as weapon batteries with two exceptions:
1. Bombardment cannons always hit on a 4 or more, regardless of the targetâ€™s armour (even vs ordnance).
2. Bombardment cannons inflict critical hits on a roll of 4 or more, rather than just on a roll of 6.
