Gunz
: Standard Ork weapons batteries are referred to as 'gunz'. These have a random firepower which is rolled each time they are fired. The dice roll and modifier for different gunz is indicated on the Ork ship's characteristics.

Torpedo Launchas
: As with their gunz, Ork torpedoes can vary wildly in their effectiveness. The strength of a salvo from an Ork torpedo launcha is randomly generated each time it is fired by rolling the dice indicated on its characteristics. Ork ships in squadrons may not combine torpedoes into larger salvoes.

Heavy Gunz
: Heavy gunz roll to hit like ordinary weapons batteries but do not count gunnery modifiers for range. Each hit scored by heavy gunz causes double damage, ie, two hits instead of one.

Fighta-Bommas
: Ork attack craft are known as fighta-bommas and perform the roles of both interceptor and bomber. This hybrid approach means that they function as fighters normally but can attack ships as if they were bombers. However, when attacking a ship, each squadron only rolls a D3 (rather than a D6) for the number of attacks they inflict.
