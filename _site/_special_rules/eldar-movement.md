name: Eldar Movement
---
The movement rules below replace the normal movement rules for Eldar ships.  Assume anything not modified below applies normally to the Eldar.

Eldar ships move in their movement phase and in the ordnance phase of their own tum. Note that they do not move in the ordnance phase of the enemy's tum. Before an Eldar ship moves, it may tum to face any direction. It always turns before it moves and then remains facing in that direction until the start of its next move. Work out the speed an Eldar ship can move at after it has turned. Its speed depends on its facing towards the sunward table edge. 


All Eldar ships have three speeds (for example, 10/20/30). The first is used if the sunward table edge is in the Eldar ship's front fire arc; the second is used if the sunward table edge is in its rear fire arc; and the third is used if the sunward table edge is in its left or right fire arcs. If the sunward table edge lies on the line between two fire arcs, the Eldar player may choose which he uses.
Eldar ships have no minimum move distances. They move from zero up to the maximum distance allowed by the direction of the sun. After their initial tum they travel in a straight line and may not make additional turns as they move. If under Lock-On special orders, Eldar ships cannot tum for EITHER movement phase.

As noted above, the Eldar move twice in each of their turns. The second move is made in the ordnance phase after any ordnance is moved, but apart from this all the rules described for Eldar movement will apply.

Special Orders
: Eldar may not use the following special orders: All Ahead Full, Burn Retros, Come To New Heading. Note: Because Eldar ships cannot use All Ahead Full special orders, they also may not ram.



Blast Markers and Gravity Wells
: Eldar are affected by Blast markers in the same way as other ships without shields - they will take a point of damage on a D6 roll of 6 and reduce their speed by 5 cm that turn. Eldar have to make a test after each of their two movements in which they encounter blast markers. Gravity wells allow Eldar to curve their normally straight line move around the planet and so the ship may make a free tum towards the planet at the end of its move (since it can tum in any direction at the start, there is no additional benefit at the start of its move).

Boarding
: An Eldar vessel intending to board an opponent may do so in either movement phase, but it may not shoot or launch ordnance before doing so. If it boards in its movement phase, it may not make its second movement.
