name: Chaos Commanders

A Chaos Warmaster (as opposed to a Lord) must always be used as a fleet commander in any Chaos fleet list that requires the use of a fleet commander. Under no circumstance can a Chaos Lord be placed on the same ship as a Warmaster. For a ship containing the Warmaster or a Lord, you can assume that he is a Chaos Space Marine, and all special rules regarding Chaos Space Marine Crews are used.
