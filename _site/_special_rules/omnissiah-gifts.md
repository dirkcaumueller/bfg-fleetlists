All Mechanicus capital ships add +1 to a given vessel's original turret value. Mechanicus capital ships must also roll a D6 once against the Mechanicus Gifts table. These improvements are already included in the point cost assigned in the Adeptus Mechanicus Fleet List. Re-roll any refit that is not applicable to the vessel.

|D6 Roll | Mechanicus Gift|
--- | ---
|1|Emergency Energy Reserves: When crippled, the ship only reduces turrets, shielding and weapons by 25% rather than 50%. The vessel still counts as crippled in every other respect.|
|2|Advanced Engines: The ship gains +5cm speed, as well as +1D6 when on All Ahead Full special orders.|
|3|Repulsor Shielding: Ignore all negative effects of having a blast marker or gas clouds in contact with the ship's base as it applies to leadership, movement and repairing critical damage. This effect goes away if the ship suffers “Shields Collapsed” critical damage.|
|4|Fleet Defence Turrets: Up to two turrets on the ship are exchanged for fleet defence turrets capable of protecting itself or any one other vessel within 15 cm each ordnance phase, adding +2 to the turret strength of the ship it is defending (this does not alter bomber attack rolls when used to defend another vessel). These otherwise work exactly as normal turrets do in all other respects.|
|5|Gyro-stabilized Targeting Matrix: Ship weapons are reduced to 75% instead of 50% when on All Ahead Full, Come To New Heading or Burn Retros special orders. Nova Cannon still cannot fire.|
|6|Augmented Weapon Relays: Weapon batteries shift left on the gunnery table before all other modifiers are applied. Lance hits count double on rolls of a 6.|
