name: Chaos Space Marine Crews

If the ship contains the Warmaster or a Lord then you can assume that he is also a Chaos Space Marine. 

Leadership
: A vessel with a Chaos Space Marine crew will have +1 Leadership (in addition to any other bonuses due to there being a Chaos Warmaster or Chaos Lord on board). Furthermore the maximum Leadership of the vessel is increased to 10.

Boarding &amp; Hit-&amp;-run
: The superior fighting skills of the Chaos Space Marines are most apparent in boarding actions. A ship with a Chaos Space Marine crew adds two to its roll when performing boarding actions and enemy conducting hit &amp; run attacks against them subtract one from their hit &amp; run result. Hit and run attacks launched by boarding torpedoes, Dreadclaws, Thunderhawks or teleportation originating from such a ship add 1 to their result.

Planetary Assault
: Ships with Chaos Space Marine crews in a Planetary Assault mission score two Assault Points for every turn they spend landing troops.

Terminator Teleport Assault
: For an extra 10 points battleships and grand cruisers with Chaos Space Marine Warmasters, Lords or crews may roll two dice when conducting hit and run teleport attacks and select which one they wish to count. They will add one as normal. This represents them unleashing their Chosen Terminators in a teleport assault.
