Leadership
: A vessel with a Chaos Space Marine crew will have +1 Leadership (in addition to any other bonuses due to there being a Chaos Warmaster or Chaos Lord on board). Furthermore the maximum Leadership of the vessel is increased to 10.

Boarding and Hit-&amp;-run
: The superior fighting skills of the Chaos Space Marines are most apparent in boarding actions. A ship with a Chaos Space Marine crew adds +2 to its roll (this replaces the standard +1 bonus for Chaos vessels) when performing boarding actions, and enemy conducting hit &amp; run attacks against them subtract one from their hit &amp; run result. Hit and run attacks launched by boarding torpedoes, Dreadclaws, Thunderhawks or teleportation originating from such a ship add 1 to their result.

Planetary Assault
: Ships with Chaos Space Marine crews in a Planetary Assault mission score two Assault Points for every turn they spend landing troops.

Terminator Teleport Assault
: Battleships and grand cruisers with Chaos Space Marine Crews may embark Chosen Terminators for +10 pts, allowing them to roll two dice when conducting hit and run teleport attacks and select which one they wish to count.

Marks of Chaos
: A ship with a Chaos Space Marine crew may have a Mark of Chaos, even if a Warmaster or Lord does not captain it.

Capital Ship Squadrons 
: If capital ships are grouped as squadrons then each squadron may only contain a single Warmaster or Lord and that ship must lead the squadron. Similarly a squadron may not include ships with different Marks of Chaos.
