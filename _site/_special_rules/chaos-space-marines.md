name: Chaos Space Marine Crew

Leadership
: A vessel with a Chaos Space Marine crew will have +1 Leadership (in addition to any other bonuses due to there being a Chaos Warmaster or Chaos Lord on board). Furthermore the maximum Leadership of the vessel is increased to 10.

Boarding &amp; Hit-&amp;-run
: The superior fighting skills of the Chaos Space Marines are most apparent in boarding actions. A ship with a Chaos Space Marine crew adds +2 to its roll when performing boarding actions and enemy conducting hit &amp; run attacks against them subtract one from their hit &amp; run result. Hit and run attacks launched by boarding torpedoes, Dreadclaws, Thunderhawks or teleportation originating from such a ship add 1 to their result.

Planetary Assault
: Ships with Chaos Space Marine crews in a Planetary Assault mission score two Assault Points for every turn they spend landing troops.

Terminator Teleport Assault
: Battleships and grand cruisers with Chaos Space Marine Crews may embark Chosen Terminators for +10 pts, allowing them to roll two dice when conducting hit and run teleport attacks and select which one they wish to count.

Marks of Chaos
: A ship with a Chaos Space Marine crew may have a Mark of Chaos, even if a Warmaster or Lord does not captain it. However there are some restrictions on exactly which Mark it can have based on the Chaos Space Marine Legion that controls it. Even if a Warmaster or Lord captains a ship, if it has a Chaos Space Marine crew the choice of Mark of Chaos is limited as well. The options are shown in the table below.

|Legion |Marks|
--- | ---
|World Eaters|Must have Mark of Khorne only|
|Emperor’s Children|Must have Mark of Slaanesh only|
|Death Guard|Must have Mark of Nurgle only|
|Thousand Sons|Must have Mark of Tzeentch only|
|Black Legion|May have any one Mark|
|Others|May not have any Mark|

Legion Fleets
: If the Warmaster’s ship has a Chaos Space Marine crew then all other ships in the fleet that have Chaos Space Marine crew must be of the same legion, unless a Chaos Lord captains them. Rivalry Members of the Emperor’s Children and the World Eaters cannot be combined in the same fleet. Similarly members of the Death Guard and Thousand Sons may not be combined in the same fleet. 

Capital Ship Squadrons 
: If capital ships are grouped as squadrons then each squadron may only contain a single Warmaster or Lord and that ship must lead the squadron. Similarly a squadron may not include ships with differen  Marks of Chaos. 

*Example: A fleet Warmaster’s ship has a Chaos Space Marine crew of the Death Guard. His ship has the Mark of Nurgle. His fleet contains six other cruisers, three ships have Chaos Space Marine crew and one of these also has a Chaos Lord. The two Chaos Space Marine ships without Lords must be crewed by the Death Guard and must therefore have the Mark of Nurgle. The ship containing the Lord can be Death Guard as well but doesn’t have to be as it could represent an allied force from another legion. Because the fleet contains members of the Death Guard the Lord’s ship may not be crewed by the Thousand Sons but may be represent any other legion. Let’s assume it is the Emperor’s Children and therefore has the Mark of Slaanesh. When organising these ships into squadrons the Warmaster and Lord’s ships may not be in the same squadron and each must command any squadron they do join. The Chaos Lord’s squadron may not contain any ships with a Mark other than that of Slaanesh and the Warmaster’s squadron may not include any ships with a Mark other than that of Nurgle.*
