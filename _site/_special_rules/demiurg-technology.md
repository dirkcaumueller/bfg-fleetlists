Demiurg Stronghold, Bastion and Citadel class vessels use the following the special rules:

Blast Markers
: Any Blast marker which a Demiurg vessel moves over is removed immediately – this includes any in base contact with the vessel at the beginning of its turn. When this happens, ships in base contact with the Demiurg vessel and sharing blast markers with them lose these (along with their effects) as well.

Blast markers have no effect on the movement of the Demiurg ship, nor do they face any other negative effects of moving through blast markers, though any leadership checks they were required to make before the movement phase are still affected normally by blast markers. 

Keep markers ‘hoovered up’ like this to one side so they can be used to fire a cutting beam from the prow in the shooting phase. Note that Blast markers moved over must be removed, the Demiurg player can’t choose to remove some markers and leave others in place.

Celestial phenomena
: Demiurg ships are totally unaffected by solar flares, gas and dust clouds and radiation bursts. Do not place blast markers in contact with them for celestial phenomena of any kind

Deployment and Scenarios
: Aside from the Tau, who appear to have the strongest known connection with the Demiurg, a number of races have on occasion been reported as having made contact with these aliens. Any fleet except Orks, Tyranids and Necrons can use Demiurg Bastion class vessels; they are purchased as cruisers but do not contribute to the number of ships required to gain access to battleships, grand cruisers, etc. Demiurg ships can never carry fleet commanders, use fleet commander re-rolls or be placed in squadrons with non-Demiurg vessels. Tau fleets (and other races whose fleet list specifically include the Demiurg) ignore these restrictions and should instead select Demiurg vessels using the entries given in their fleet list. 

Mercenaries 
: Unless the fleet is entirely composed of Demiurg ships they are considered to be mercenaries and will not continue to fight if crippled. Crippled Demiurg ships will attempt to disengage every turn and run for the nearest point on the nearest table edge if they fail. However, if the Demiurg ship is part of a fleet fighting against Orks it will only disengage if first reduced to only having 1 or 2 Damage points remaining.
