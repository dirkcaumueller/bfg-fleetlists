Attack Craft
: As with their starships, Tau attack craft is operated by the Air Caste, who provide pilots for the Barracuda fighters and Manta bombers. Both of these forms of attack craft also form an important part of Tau forces planetside, with the Mantas transporting whole Hunter cadres consisting of dozens of Fire Warriors while Barracudas provide air support.

|Attack Craft |Speed |Notes |
| --- | --- | --- 
|Barracuda| 25 cm| Fighter
|Manta | 20 cm| Bomber, _Resilient_: may roll a 4+ to save against removal by a single fighter attack per ordnance phase.

Tau Missiles
: Tau missiles
are able to alter both their speed and course throughout flight, so may move at any speed between 20 cm and 40 cm (i.e. must move at least 20 cm, cannot move more than 40 cm) each ordnance phase. They are also guided. Each ordnance phase the missiles may change course by 45 degrees at the start of their movement. 

The sophistication of Tau missiles comes at the cost of decreased endurance. Each turn _after_ the turn it was launched, roll 1D6 for each point of strength in each missile salvo and reduce the strength of the salvo by 1 for every 6 rolled.
