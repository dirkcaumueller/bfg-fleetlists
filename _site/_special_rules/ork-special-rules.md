name: Ork Special Rules
---
Leadership
: All Ork ships reduce their Leadership by -1 from whatever they rolled, giving them a Leadership range of 5 to 8.

All Ahead Full Special Orders
: Orks do not need to pass a Command check to use All Ahead Full special orders. However, Ork drives are less efficient than those of other races and are often short on fuel, so they only travel an extra 2D6cm on All Ahead Full orders instead of 4D6cm.

Boarding
: Orks they get a +1 bonus in boarding actions to represent their savagery. 

Dakka Dakka
: Ork capital ships can add +2 turrets to their ships for +20 points (this is not the same thing as saying “up to two turrets at +10 points each”). Ork escorts may add +1 turret for +5 points per escort unless a particular fleet lists adjusts this. If this option is taken, every escort in a given squadron must take the refit, not just individual escorts in a squadron.
