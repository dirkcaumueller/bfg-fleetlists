Leadership
: Only hive ships have a leadership value, which is purchased at a fixed value from the Hive Fleet list. During the Movement phase, each hive ship can make a Command check to change or ignore Instinctive Behaviour for themselves or another ship/squadron within 45 cm. If the test is successful the Tyranid player has control of the ship/squadron and may place it on special orders if desired, without requiring a second command check.

Attempts to use synaptic control count as a Command check. However, if one hive ship fails a command check this does not prevent another hive ship attempting to use synaptic control. In effect each hive ship can make at least one attempt to override Instinctive Behaviour. You may test for synaptic control over a ship which failed the test the same turn, including other Hive ships, as long as there is another Hive ship within range. 

Tyranid ordnance (fighters, assault boats, torpedoes) is not subject to synaptic control or Instinctive Behaviour – just move them like normal ordnance.

Movement and Special Orders
: All Tyranid vessels follow Instinctive Orders unless the Hive Mind (i.e. you, the player!) tells a ship or squadron to do something different via the psychic conduit of the hive ships. For ships or squadrons using Instinctive Behaviour, read down the table below and give the ship/squadron the first appropriate action or special order you come to. No Command check is needed for special orders, but there may be specific activities that must be undertaken in the vessel’s movement. 

| Does the ship meet this condition? | Take this action, applying the relevant **Special Order** if present. |
| --- | --- |
| **1.** Normal movement will take the ship(s) into a gas/dust cloud, asteroid field, planetary rings, minefield, warp rift or other dangerous celestial phenomena? | **Burn Retros**. A turn must be made away from the celestial phenomena. |
| **2.** Nearest enemy is in front fire arc and less than 15 cm away? You can opt to skip this condition if the ship is armed with bio-plasma. | No special order. Must move into contact and initiate a boarding action if possible. |
| **3.** Nearest enemy is in front fire arc and more than 90 cm away?| **All Ahead Full**. Add +2D6 cm to movement instead of +4D6 cm. |
| **4.** Nearest enemy is within rear fire arc? This condition only applies to escort ships. | **Come to New Heading**|
| **5.** Enemy is in front fire arc and within range/fire arc of operational bio-weapon?| **Lock On** |
| **6.** Ordnance needs reloading? | **Reload Ordnance** |
| **7.** None of the above conditions apply?| No special order. If there is a planet on the table, the ship/ squadron must end its movement closer to it of possible. Otherwise move at half speed straight ahead.|


_For example: A Tyranid cruiser wishes to move towards the enemy fleet in support of its hive ship but fails the Ld test. We check theInstinctive Orders table – there are no celestial phenomena or enemy ships close or in range but there is a planet on the table. The cruiser has to move towards the planet even though this actually takes it further away from the enemy fleet it wished to close with._

Brace for Impact
: Tyranid ships/squadrons can go onto Brace for Impact orders at any time by testing against the leadership of the nearest hive ship within 45 cm. If no hive ships are within range then bio-ships use a default leadership of 7 for the test instead. 
As normal this order is only removed at the end of the Tyranids’ next turn. Ships on Brace For Impact orders which are acting instinctively obey the movement restrictions listed above but do not change their special orders

All Ahead Full
: If a ship goes All Ahead Full under synaptic control (by leadership test) instead of Instinctive Behaviour, i  may move an additional +4D6 cm instead of +2D6 cm. Having the Adrenaline Sacs refit adds +1D6 in either case.
