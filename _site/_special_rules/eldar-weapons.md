Eldar ships carry three main weapon systems which are described below.

Pulsar Lance 
: Pulsar lances fire volleys of high energy laser bolts. These count as lance shots, and hit on a 4+ no matter what the target's armour. However, if a pulsar lance shot hits, then you may roll to hit again and you may keep on rolling to hit until you miss or the lance has scored a total of 3 hits. 

Weapon Batteries 
: Eldar weapons batteries are short-ranged weapons that unleash a torrent of fire. They employ sophisticated targeting systems which make them very accurate even at extreme angles of attack. To represent their accuracy, Eldar weapons batteries count all targets as 'closing' on the Gunnery table, no matter what the target's actual aspect is. This aside, all the normal rules apply. 

Torpedoes 
: Eldar torpedoes use sophisticated targeter scrambling systems to make themselves virtually undetectable until they strike. To represent this, defensive turrets only hit Eldar torpedoes on a roll of 6, rather than on a roll of 4+ as is normally the case. In addition, the highly accurate targeting sensors on Eldar torpedoes allow you to re-roll the dice to hit for any torpedo that misses a target on the first attempt.
