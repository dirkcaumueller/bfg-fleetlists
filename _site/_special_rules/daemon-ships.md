name: Daemon Ships
---
Command
: A Daemon ship may never be commanded by a Warmaster or a Chaos Lord. A Daemon ship may never have a Chaos Space Marine crew.

Daemon ships cannot carry Exterminatus weapons and do not score any points for landing troops in a planetary assault. Daemonships cannot be used in squadrons.

Any Daemon ship may have a single Mark of Chaos with the same effects and cost in points as described in the Battlefleet Gothic rulebook.

Warp Translation
: A Daemonship may be kept off table at the start of a game while the 	rest of the fleet is deployed. In the End phase of any Chaos turn after the first, the Daemon Ship may enter play from the Warp as follows:\
Select a friendly or enemy Capital ship, and position the Daemonship within 20 cm of the chosen vessel facing in any direction. Next, roll 4D6 and a Scatter dice and reposition the Daemonship accordingly, keeping the ship on the same heading. A Daemonship cannot be forced to disengage by a scatter roll that places it off the table. If a Daemonship scatters off the table when deploying, place the Daemonship so that its base is completely on the table on the point of the table edge indicated by the scatter dice, facing any direction. If a ‘Hit’ is rolled on the Scatter dice, then the Daemonship arrives on target. The arriving Daemonship is unaffected by celestial phenomena and does not trigger attack by ordnance markers it may happen to land on. If it would appear in contact with an enemy vessel, reposition it by up to 1 cm so that it is out of contact.

Spectral Daemonships
: When first placed on the table, a Daemonship is *spectral*. Any enemy vessel attempting a special order when within 15 cm of the Daemonship is at -1 Leadership (if the ship also has a Mark of Slaanesh the penalties are cumulative). The Daemonship cannot move, shoot, board or conduct any action in any way, though any Marks it may have still take effect immediately. It also may not be shot at, boarded, rammed or have any action done to it while spectral.
At the end of any subsequent Chaos End phase the Daemonship may complete the translation to real space on a D6 roll of 2+. This final translation cannot be made if the Daemonship is in contact with an enemy vessel. No actions can be undertaken in the End phase during which final translation occurs. From this point on the Daemonship is solid and fights like a normal ship. If a Daemon ship fully materializes in contact with celestial phenomena, it suffers any effects of those celestial phenomena, such as gas clouds, asteroid fields, etc. before the start of its movement phase. However, if it materializes in an asteroid field, it may then attempt to avoid damage by making a leadership check normally.


Haunting
: A Daemonship may disengage at the end of any Chaos Movement phase without having to make any dice roll. It simply drops back into the Warp leaving no trace. A disengaged Daemonship may re-enter play on any Chaos turn following the one in which it disengages. This is done following the translation rules detailed above. When a Daemonship is ‘haunting’ or is spectral it can still suffer damage from fire critical hits. If it was damaged when it disengaged it may be repaired when it returns, roll a D6: 

|D6 |ROLL RESULT|
--- | ---
|1–3|No change|
|4–5|+1 hull point|
|6|+2 hull points|

Add +1 to the roll if it is a battleship, and +1 for each full turn the Daemonship spent in the Warp.
In addition to repairing damage, they may repair critical hits while in the warp rolling normally, repairing critical damage on a 4+ as opposed to a 6. However, Daemonships may not make repair rolls in  the end phase they are first deployed when returning into play. If Daemonships repair enough hits while “haunting” to no longer be crippled, they will still count as disengaged for purposes of victory points but will no longer count as crippled. A returning Daemonship cannot come back with more hits than it could normally have. At the end of the game a Daemonship which disengaged (even just once) will count as having disengaged for Victory points purposes, unless of course it is destroyed or crippled when the normal rules apply. 

Daemonships in Campaigns
: Daemonships do not automatically regain hits after each battle. They have to be regained either in a game by warp translation or by expending repair points, or they can be withdrawn normally.
