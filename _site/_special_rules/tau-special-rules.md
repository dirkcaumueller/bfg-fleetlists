Boarding Actions
: All Tau Kor'vattra ships (_Explorers_, _Heroes_, and _Merchants_) halve their boarding value when fighting in assaults.

Teleport Attacks
: Tau may not conduct teleport attacks.

Escort Squadrons
: Defenders are fielded in squadrons of 2â€“6, and may be combined with Messengers. Messengers operate as individual ships or as part of a squadron of Defenders. 

The Orcas from each parent ship use the same Leadership as the parent and must act as a squadron, but act independently: they are deployed separately from their parent and activate different orders. If the parent ships are squadroned together, their Orcas may be squadroned together also: declare this after rolling for capital ship leadership and forming capital ship squadrons. The normal squadron limit of six still applies, so you may find it necessary to have more than one Orca squadron associated with a capital ship squadron. When Orcas from multiple squadroned parent ships form a combined squadron (or squadrons), all use the highest leadership from among the parents. Orcas may not be squadroned with any other form of escort. Wardens may only squadron with other Wardens or Castellans. A single capital ship may carry only Orcas **or** Wardens on its gravitic hooks.
