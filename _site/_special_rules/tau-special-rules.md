Boarding Actions
: All Tau Kor'vattra ships (_Explorers_, _Heroes_, and _Merchants_) halve their boarding value when fighting in assaults.

Teleport Attacks
: Tau may not conduct teleport attacks.

Escort Squadrons
: Defenders are fielded in squadrons of 2–6, and may be combined with Messengers. Messengers operate as individual ships or as part of a squadron of Defenders. 

Orcas (but not Wardens) fight with the leadership of their gravitic hook parent ship: they do not roll for leadership. They still deploy, fight, and go on special orders as a separate squadron to their parent. Orcas may only be squadroned together with other Orcas (subject to normal 2–6 ship squadron limitations), and may only do so if their parent capital ships are also squadroned together. Wardens may only squadron with other Wardens or Castellans. A single capital ship may carry only Orcas **or** Wardens on its gravitic hooks.
