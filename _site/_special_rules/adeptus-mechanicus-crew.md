Adeptus Mechanicus Leadership
: To determine base leadership for a given Adeptus Mechanicus vessel, roll a D6 against the following table:
|D6 | Leadership|
--- | ---
|1|Ld 7|
|2-3|Ld 8|
|4-6|Ld 9|

Any vessel that rolls a 6 when determining base leadership may select any one desired refit from the Mechanicus Gifts table instead of rolling for it randomly (this does not mean you get an extra one!). This option cannot be used if the vessel embarks an Archmagos Veneratus.

Boarding Adeptus Mechanicus Vessels
: Enemies attack Adeptus Mechanicus vessels may re-roll the dice if desired during boarding actions as well as Hit and Run attacks. Mechanicus vessels (including battleships) do not normally utilize assault boats or boarding torpedoes.

Firing on hulks
: Unlike other fleets, Mechanicus vessels can take a leadership check to fire upon their own vessels that have been hulked to deny them to the enemy. This rule only applies to Mechanicus vessels shooting at Mechanicus drifting hulks, and not Imperial Navy, reserve or allied vessels in the fleet.
