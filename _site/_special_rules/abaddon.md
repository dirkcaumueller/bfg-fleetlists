name: Abaddon

Command
: Abaddon can be chosen to act as fleet commander in any game in which the Chaos fleet is worth 1,000 points or more. You may not place a Chaos Lord on the same ship as Abaddon. Abaddon has Leadership 10 and provides one re-roll *per turn* to any fleet that he commands.

Boarding Actions
: Abaddon is accompanied by his company of Black Legion Traitor Marines aboard the ship he is commanding. The ship doubles its value in boarding actions and gains an extra +1 Boarding modifier.

Hit-&amp;-Run Attacks
: Hit-&amp;-run raids deduct -1 from their dice roll against Abaddon’s ship. If Abaddon’s vessel makes any hit-&amp;-run teleport attacks, add +1 to the dice roll for the attack as it will be undertaken by elite Black Legion Terminators. Boarding torpedoes and assault boats from Abaddon’s ship will be manned by more mundane minions and do not receive this modifier.

“You have failed me for the last time…”
: Abaddon the Despoiler does not tolerate failure. If Abaddon’s re-roll is used for a test that is failed a second time, he will become angry. In the Chaos Shooting phase Abaddon will direct at least half the available firepower and lance strength of the ship he is commanding against the weaklings who have failed him (if within range and fire arc). Resolve the attack as normal, just as if Abaddon’s vessel were an enemy. The victims of his wrath (assuming they survive) gain a +1 Leadership increase for the remainder of the game (this bonus Ld may only be claimed once). If the object of Abaddon’s wrath is not in range and/or fire arc he will leave them to their fate – Abaddon’s re-rolls may no longer be used on it. This means that no further Commander re-rolls may be used on the ship or squadron unless it is carrying its own Chaos Lord with a Mark of Tzeentch. Should this dreadful failure occur on Abaddon’s own ship, it will lose one Damage Point as the Black Legion massacre those who failed him. No Leadership increase is gained.
