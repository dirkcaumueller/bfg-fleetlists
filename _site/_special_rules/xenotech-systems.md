Rogue Trader capital ships and escorts commonly bear refits of uncertain origin. To represent this each Rogue Trader cruiser and escort squadron may roll one random crew skill for +10% point value. In addition, each Rogue Trader vessel may roll randomly against the Xenotech System table below for +15 points per cruiser or +5 points per escort. For an additional +5 points per ship, the player can select the desired technology instead of rolling randomly for it. Auxiliary vessels in a Rogue Trader escort squadron can only use these refits if they are in a squadron that includes at least three Rogue Trader escorts.
