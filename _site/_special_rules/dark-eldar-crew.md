name: Dark Eldar Crew

Boarding Actions
: The Dark Eldar are furious and brutal pirates, fanatical in the pursuit of violence and the hunt for captives. Their all-consuming blood lust can often overcome them, leaving them in an uncontrolled frenzy. Dark Eldar receive a bonus +1 modifier in the first round of any boarding action and a -1 modifier in any subsequent rounds.

Hit-and-Run
: The Dark Eldar receive a +1 to any Hit and Run attacks including those from Slavebringer assault boats but excluding Impaler Assault Modules (meaning they will normally succeed automatically).

Slavetaking
: Slavetaking may be performed instead of any Hit & Run, including teleporter and Impaler attacks. They may forgo rolling on the Hit & Run Critical Hit table in return for +10 Victory points.

When using Impalers for slavetaking, they collect +30 victory points instead of +10 points. Brace saves may be taken against Slavetaking. Any escort-sized ship is in addition considered destroyed if 30 or more victory points are collected from it by slavetaking.

Slavetaking cannot be conducted against Necron or Tyranid fleets.
