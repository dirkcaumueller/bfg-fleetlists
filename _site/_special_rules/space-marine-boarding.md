name: Space Marine Boarding
---
Space Marine ships add +2 to their D6 roll when they fight in a boarding action and +1 when they make any hit and run attack.

Enemy hit and run attacks against a Space Marine ship deduct 1 from their dice rolls (and so will fail on a roll of 1 or 2 before modification).
