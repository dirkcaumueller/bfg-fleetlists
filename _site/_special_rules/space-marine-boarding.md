Space Marine ships add +2 to their D6 roll when they fight in a boarding action and +1 when they make any hit and run attack.

Enemy hit and run attacks against a Space Marine ship deduct 1 from their dice rolls (and so will fail on a roll of 1 or 2 before modification).

Drop Pods
: All Space Marine capital ships are equipped with drop pods. These add nothing to their profile and are not treated as ordnance in any respect. Drop pods enable Space Marine capital ships to quickly deploy Space Marines to the surface and impart +2 assault points for each capital ship during a planetary assault instead of +1.

Honour Guard
: Some Space Marine vessels are noted as carrying the Chapter's Honour Guard. Once per turn you may use the Honor Guard, if your fleet list includes them. All the normal rules for teleport attacks apply, except that they may be used in addition to a normal teleport attack that turn. The player may roll two dice and choose which one to use as the result, including the normal +1 bonus for being Space Marines.

Terminator Boarding Parties
: Once per turn a vessel equipped with Terminator boarding parties may use them when conducting a hit and run teleport attack. They roll two dice for its hit and run attack and apply both results, including the normal +1 bonus for being Space Marines. Terminators may be used in addition to a normal teleport attack that turn.
