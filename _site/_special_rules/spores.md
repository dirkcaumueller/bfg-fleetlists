name: Spores

Tyranid ships do not have turrets or shields in the normal sense, and instead rely on emitting a constantly replenished physical barrier of spore clouds. 
Tyranid vessels have a number of spore clouds which are specified in the bio-ship’s characteristics. If a Tyranid ship is crippled, its spore cyst strength is not affected as the vessel’s self-defence organisms go into over-time to try to protect their host creature.

Spores as Shields
: A spore cloud will absorb any hit generated by weapons fire except from those that specifically ignore shields, such as Warp Cannon or Particle Whip rolls of 6. Special weapons designed to affect shields will affect spore clouds in an identical manner. Spore clouds are affected by Blast markers just like shields on an ordinary ship, place a marker in base contact for each cloud that absorbs a hit. Spores will also protect a bio- ship against shooting and potential damage from celestial phenomena in the same manner as shields.

If an enemy ship gets in base contact with a Tyranid vessel it will suffer spore impacts. Enemy vessels treat this similar to blast markers. They lose -5 cm speed and ships with a Shield strength of 0 (i.e. Eldar or ships suffering the Shields Collapse critical) also suffers a point of damage on a D6 roll of 6. However, this test only needs to be done once per Movement phase, regardless of how many Tyranid ships make base contact with the same enemy vessel. If a Tyranid vessel and an enemy vessel end their movement in base contact with each other, a blast marker is placed between the two ships.

Spores as Turrets
: If attacked by ordnance a bio-ship treats its spore cysts as the number of turrets it can bring to bear. Each Blast marker in contact with the ship will reduce one spore cloud to hitting on a 6+ instead of 4+. If a spore is already rolling against ordnance that requires 6+ to hit with turrets (such as against Eldar attack craft), being in contact with blast markers has no additional effect. 

Unlike normal turret fire, both torpedoes and attack craft can be targeted by the spores in the same turn. Bio-ships can mass their spore cysts in close formation against ordnance as described for other ships, but they do not gain any shielding benefits by doing so. Tyranid spore clouds will NOT intercept Tyranid ordnance. The number of spores a ship has is subtracted from a bomber's die roll to determine number of attacks made like a true turret value. Blast markers in contact have no effect on this.
