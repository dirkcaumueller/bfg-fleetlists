name: Tyranid Xenobiology
--- 
Navigation
: All Tyranid ships are naturally adapted void-swimming organisms and make all Leadership checks to navigate celestial phenomena on a default leadership of 10.

Shooting
: Tyranid ships always target the nearest enemy ship unless a special Vanguard drone ship ‘highlights’ another enemy within range. No leadership test is allowed for Tyranid ships to select a target other than the nearest. Ordnance markers are always ignored and may not be fired on at all.

Vanguard drone ships highlight all enemies (including ordnance) within 15 cm, and these can be targeted freely by any other vessels in the Tyranid fleet which are within range, without requiring a separate command check to ignore closer vessels.

Boarding
: Tyranids are a horror in Boarding actions. A fearless, animalistic rush of clawed, fanged monsters has been the death knell of many a ship.

Tyranids always count double their boarding value, plus they roll 2D6 and use the highest result in boarding actions. Tyranids ignore all blast marker effects when boarding enemy vessels. They do however lose a measure of their spore protection for being in contact with blast markers due to placing one on the target vessel when boarding; place the blast marker at the point where the target and the Tyranid vessel make contact. While they ignore all blast marker effects when boarding, the target vessel does not. As such, Tyranids get a +1 for the enemy being in contact with blast markers.

All Is Lost
: Capital ships can attempt to self destruct when boarded by Tyranids (not when boarding a Tyranid vessel) by passing a Leadership test in the End phase. If the test is failed the crew must face their terrible fate at the hands of the Tyranids. If the test is passed roll a D6; on a 1–3 the ship suffers the catastrophic damage result of plasma drive overload. On a 4–6 the ship suffers the warp drive implosion result instead.

Hit-&-Run Attacks
: Hit-&-Run attacks against Tyranid ships roll 2D6 and take the lowest result. When conducting Hit-&-Run attacks of any type against Tyranid escorts, roll 2D6 and take the lowest D6 for the roll, destroying the escort on a roll of 4+. 

Tyranid ships can make Hit-&-Run teleporting attacks just like other ships in the End phase. The Tyranid player adds +1 to the result when making Hit-&-Run raids.

Crippled
: To summarise, Tyranid ships suffer the following penalties when crippled:
- Speed: -5 cm
- Spore cysts: Full strength
- Bio-plasma: Half strength
- Pyro-acid batteries: Half strength
- Feeder Tentacles: May not be used
- Massive claws: May not be used
- Torpedoes & Attack Craft: None may be launched

Critical Hits & Catastrophic Damage
: Tyranids do not use the normal critical hit and catastrophic damage tables. Instead they use the tables presented here. If a critical hit is rolled which cannot be applied, for example a ship with no prow weapons gets a Prow Armament wounded critical, apply the next highest critical instead. In this case the ship would suffer thorax armament damage.

**Tyranid Critical Hits**

| 2D6 Roll | Extra Damage | Result |
| 2 | +0 | **Spore cysts injured**: The ship’s spore cysts are badly damaged by the hit. The ship’s spore cysts may not be used until they have been repaired. |
| 3 | +0 | **Starboard armament wounded**: The starboard armament is severely injured by the hit. The ship’s starboard armament may not be used again until it has been repaired. |
| 4 | +0 | **Port armament wounded**: Heavy damage wounds the port side weaponry. The ship’s port armament may not be used until it has been repaired. |
| 5 | +0 | **Prow armament wounded**: The bio-ship’s prow is ripped open. Its prow armament may not be used until it has been repaired. |
| 6 | +1 | **Thorax armament wounded**: A large tear in the vessel’s thorax prevents its weapons discharging. The ship may not use its thorax weapons until the damage is repaired. |
| 7 | +0 | **Heavy wound!** Internal organs are ruptured and massive bleeding weakens the vessel. Roll to repair the heavy wound in the End phase, if the wound is not repaired it causes 1 point of extra damage and keeps bleeding. |
| 8 | +1 | **Discharge vents wounded**: One of the huge biological valves that manoeuvre the ship through the ether are crippled. The bio-ship may not turn until the damage is repaired. |
| 9 | +0 | **Synapse severed**: The nerve bundles which connect the ship to the Hive Mind are badly damaged. The bio-ship cannot have its instinctual orders overridden by the Hive Mind until the damage is repaired. |
| 10 | +0 | **Spore cysts ruptured**: The ship’s spore cysts suffer larvae failure and seal up. The bio-ship may no longer use its spore cysts. This damage cannot be repaired. |
| 11 | +D3 | **Severe wound**: A huge gash is torn in the ship’s hull, vital fluids freezing instantly as they spill into the void. |
| 12 | +D6 | **Massive haemorrhage**: The armoured hide of the ship suffers immense damage, spraying alien ichor far into the void. Make a bio-plasma attack with Strength 1 against any other target within 2D6 cm. Holofields do not protect against this damage. |

**Tyranid Catastrophic Damage**

| 2D6 Roll | Extra Blast Markers | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
2-7 | +1 | **Drifting Carcasse**: The limp remains of the bio-ship drift through the void, pushed forward by sporadic death spasms. The wreck moves 4D6 cm forward in each of its subsequent movement phases. Place a blast marker in contact with the corpse’s base after each move. 
8-9 | +1 | **Death throes**: The ship is wracked by violent muscle contractions, and ichor seeps from dozens of horrendous wounds. The wreck moves 4D6 cm forward in each of its subsequent Movement phases. Place a Blast marker in contact with the corpse’s base and roll on the Catastrophic Damage table again after its move.
10-11 | Half Damage | **Biological eruption**: The ship spectacularly explodes, hurling gobbets of viral slime and acid over a wide area. Remove the ship from play, leaving behind a number of blast markers equal to half its starting number of hits. Make a pyro- acid attack against every target within 3D6 cm, with a firepower equal to the ship’s starting damage
12 | Starting Damage | **Bio-plasma detonation**: With a blinding flash the ship’s main arteries explode with bio-plasma engulfing the creature and spraying dangerously in all directions. Remove the ship from play, leaving behind a number of blast markers equal to its starting number of hits. Make a bio-plasma attack against every target within 3D6 cm, with a Strength equal to half the exploding vessel’s starting damage. Shields and holofields are not effective against the detonation.
