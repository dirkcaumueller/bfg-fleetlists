name: Bakka Starship Defences
---
Any capital ship of Battlefleet Bakka can add +1 turret to its profile for +5 points. This upgrade does not count against refits ships can take normally. Reserve vessels may not be given this upgrade, but any vessels from the Battlefleet Bakka fleet list used as reserves in other fleets may take it with them.

When used with Battlefleet Bakka, Adeptus Mechanicus capital ships may take the Fleet Defense Turrets refit for +5 pts instead of rolling for it randomly on the Mechanicus Gifts table. Two turrets on a ship are exchanged for fleet defense turrets capable of protecting itself or any one other vessel within 15cm each ordnance phase, adding +2 to the turret strength of the ship it is defending (this does not alter bomber attack rolls when used to defend another vessel).
