name: Armageddon Gun

The Armageddon gun may not be fired if the ship has been crippled or is on *Burn Retros*, *All Ahead Full* or *Brace For Impact* special orders.

The Armageddon gun can only be fired directly ahead of the ship. To fire the Armageddon gun, place the nova cannon template so that it is touching the Planet Killer’s stem and then move it directly ahead 90cm. If the hole in the centre of the template passes over a ship’s base (friend or foe!), that ship suffers D6 automatic hits. If any other part of the nova cannon marker moves over a ship’s base then the ship suffers one automatic hit. Hits take down shields exactly as normal. Ordnance touched by the template is destroyed. Once the Armageddon gun has fired you must use *Reload Ordnance* orders before it can fire again. If you roll a double 6 for a Reload Ordnance check, then the Armageddon gun has disastrously malfunctioned, inflicting a critical hit on the Planet Killer and rendering the Armageddon gun useless for the rest of the battle. On a roll of any other double, the Armageddon gun can be fired once more before it must be shut down to prevent overloading. Note that as the Planet Killer also has torpedoes, it is possible that you will need to use Reload Ordnance orders for these at the same time as for the Armageddon gun. In this case, only make one Command check. 

The Armageddon gun is a line of sight weapon and cannot fire through obstacles or celestial phenomena that act as normal line of sight obstructions, such as planets, moons, asteroid fields, etc. However, place D6 blast markers at the point the Armageddon gun template contacted the asteroid field, moon, etc. for the vaporized rock left in its wake. 

Exterminatus 
: The Planet Killer, as its unsubtle name suggests, is designed to attack worlds. This makes it particularly appropriate for the Exterminatus scenario. If the Chaos fleet is attacking, it can include the Planet Killer instead of using modified exterminators or a Blackstone Fortress. The Planet Killer does not lose any of its weapons for being an exterminator, but if the Armageddon gun cannot be used for any reason then it can no longer act as an exterminator and the Chaos player loses the battle automatically. Though the Planet Killer must enter low orbit to fire a planet-killing shot like other vessels, it has a range of 60 cm and does not need to roll a 4+ to destroy the planet.

The Planet Killer must declare it is charging over three consecutive turns. No leadership check is required, but the ship may not turn, shoot or go on any special orders, including *Brace For Impact*. Once started, the process cannot be stopped, during which time the ship gains +2 shields. After the movement phase of the third turn, the ship immediately fires by moving the Nova Cannon template directly in front of he vessel 60 cm (not 90 cm). If any part of the template touches any ship’s base, that ship is completely destroyed, no saves allowed. The first planet or moon touched by the centre hole is removed on a 2+ in D3 turns and replaced by a 2D6×2D6 asteroid field. This shot can fire through asteroid fields but will not remove them by doing so. After firing this shot, the Planet Killer must pass a *Reload Ordnance* special order for two turns to bring the Armageddon Gun back online, during which time it may not fire any weapons at all but moves normally.
