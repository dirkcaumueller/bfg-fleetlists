Dark Eldar Weapons Batteries
: Dark Eldar rely on sophisticated targeting technology which allows them to count all targets as ‘closing’ on the Gunnery table, no matter what the target’s actual aspect is. Other than this, the weapons batteries fire as normal.

Phantom Lance
: This is the Dark Eldar equivalent of the pulsar, using dark matter powered lasers. Roll a dice for each point of the Phantom lance’s strength when firing, with the following effects:

|D6 Roll | Effect |
|---|---|
|1–3 | Miss |
|4 | 1 hit |
|5–6 | 2 hits |

Ordnance
: All Dark Eldar Ordnance can only be hit by turrets on a 6. This includes attack craft, any torpedo types, assault boats and orbital mines.

When orbital mines are used, they completely replace all other attack craft used by the launching carrier, with one orbital mine per launch bay.

As Dark Eldar vessels do not actually have turrets, enemy bombers do not get any bonus against turrets from escorting fighters.

Attack Craft
: Dark Eldar attack craft consist of Raptor fighters, Razorwing bombers and Slavebringer assault boats. 
Raptor fighters have a speed of 30 cm and need a 4+ to remain in play after removing ordnance as with Eldar fighters. Razorwing bombers have a speed of 20 cm. Slavebringer assault boats have a speed of 30 cm.

Torpedoes 
: Dark Eldar torpedoes use sophisticated targeter scrambling systems to make themselves virtually undetectable until they strike. Defensive turrets only hit Dark Eldar torpedoes on a roll of 6, rather than on a roll of 4+ as is normally the case. In addition, re-roll the dice to hit for any torpedo that misses a target on the first attempt.

Leech Torpedoes
: Dark Eldar ships armed with torpedoes may use leech torpedoes at no extra cost. These must be loaded with a specific Reload Ordnance roll, although a ship may start the scenario with them in the tubes by writing a note on the ship sheet. Leech torpedoes cause no damage other than a single, automatic critical hit (do not roll against armour). *Brace for Impact* can be used against this normally. Escorts are not automatically destroyed by this critical hit.

Do not roll for the effect of this critical hit, instead the leech torpedo immediately causes a -10 cm speed reduction on its target. A leech torpedo hit also prevents the target from executing any *All Ahead Full* special orders. Only one -10cm speed penalty applies regardless of the number attached – the effect is not cumulative. However, all leech hits on a ship must be repaired before the movement penalty is removed (e.g. if a ship suffers 5 leech hits, it remains at a reduced speed until all 5 hits have been repaired). Escorts can also repair this effect with a roll of 6 in the same manner capital ships repair critical damage.

Impaler Assault Module
: The Impaler is a specialised form of prow mounted attack craft. An Impaler is launched like an assault boat, and moves in the same way during the ordnance phase. Fighters which attack the Impaler do not automatically remove it from play,. Instead the Impaler rolls a D6 and remains in play on a 4+. The Impaler can only use this save once per ordnance phase, but if it does so against a fighter in base contact with a ship and subsequently survives turret fire, it may then attack that ship normally. Turrets may fire at the Impaler, in the same way as against ordnance. 

When the Impaler successfully moves into contact with an enemy ship, it makes a Hit & Run attack. Roll a D6 as normal. On a score of a 1 the Impaler’s boarders are defeated and the module may not be used for the remainder of the game. On a 2-6 the Impaler causes a critical hit. However, unlike assault boats, roll 2D6 and look up the score on the critical hits table (as opposed to just looking up the score of the Hit & Run attack). 

If the Impaler is removed (either by turrets, enemy ordnance, attack craft and so on), the Dark Eldar vessel must reload ordnance as normal before being able to fire it again (it is assumed that a damaged module limps back to its parent vessel and must await hurried repairs or else take time for its crew to transfer to a replacement). An Impaler can only be completely destroyed by a failed Hit & Run attack, which would leave it useless due to the loss of its crew. 

When Impalers are lost the owning player decides which ship from the squadron loses its Impaler. This does mean you have to keep track of which Impalers come from each squadron.

At the beginning of each of the Dark Eldar player’s turn he must remove any Impalers from the table (these are assumed to have been forced to return to their parent ship due to lack of fuel). He may of course attempt to reload ordnance during the turn in order to relaunch said Impalers (i.e. he reloads ordnance as quickly as possible to ‘turn around’ the Impalers and their crew just as soon as they arrive back at their parent ship). 

You may not launch additional Impalers if you already have a number of Impalers in play equal to the number of Impaler armed vessels in the fleet. Impalers are not deployed from launch bays in any way, shape or form, so the overall number of launch bays in a fleet does not affect the number of Impalers which you are permitted to launch or have in play.
