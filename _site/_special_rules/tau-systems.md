Railguns
: Railguns of the size mounted on warships require massive amounts of energy to fire despite Tau superconductors. Tau railguns count as standard weapon batteries in all respects.

Ion Cannons
: Ion cannon shots vaporise the object struck magnifying the energy discharge. Armour is of no value against them. They function as lances in all respects.

Gravitic Launcher
: Gravitic launchers are massive railguns where mass drivers trigger the initial acceleration before the ships gravitic field is pulsed to squeeze the missiles toward the enemy at enormous speed. The missiles are drone-controlled and exceptionally dangerous. Ships with gravitic launchers are armed with Tau missiles.

Gravitic hooks
: Gravitic Hooks are large, suspensory arms which create a gravitic sheath in which a small vessel can be transported by a larger one. You may not have more Orcas and Wardens than the gravitic hook capacity of the fleet - much of the cost of these vessels is included in that of the parent ship. A single ship may carry Orcas or Wardens, but may not carry a mix of both.

Tracking Systems
: Some Tau starships and orbital platforms boast highly advanced data storage and processing facilities to cope with the vast amounts of information they carry. When linked to ship sensors though this processing power can be used to provide a direct feed to the ships turrets. Any Tau vessel within 10 cm of a ship with tracking systems may re-roll misses when using turrets and ignores the column shift when firing batteries at ranges above 30 cm. Tracking systems are fully functional under any special order on any ship or defence equipped with them, including _Brace For Impact_.
