name: Extra Attacks

How do special abilities apply to a weapon with extra attacks?
: Special abilities (unit or weapon) that are on a weapon with extra attacks apply to, and only to, the extra attacks. All special weapon abilities (e.g. first strike) on the unit are also inherited by the extra attacks, but special unit abilities (e.g. sniper) on the unit are not.

If a unit has an extra attack on a Small Arms weapon, can it be used if the unit is in base contact with an enemy unit?
: Only if the unit is a war engine, and that hit can only be allocated to units in firefight with the war engine.
