If a formation is intermingled with a broken formation, can the extra hits from loosing the assault be taken on the broken formation?
: Yes, so long as those units are closer to the attacking formation. Units are removed for those extra hits and then broken formations are destroyed.

Does the charging formation need to get within 15cm of all intermingled formations?
: No.

Does the charging formation need to get within 15cm of the original target or can it get within 15cm of any intermingled formation?
