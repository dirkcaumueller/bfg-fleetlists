name: Allocate Hits &amp; Make Saving Throws
---
Are modifiers to an amour save cumulative? For example, does a _sniper_ hit on a unit caught in a crossfire suffer a -2 save modifier?
: Yes, all modifiers apply unless specifically stated otherwise.

If a unit suffers save modifiers so that its armour value is effectively 7+ does it still get a save?
: No, 7+ rolls are for hits only.

How are hits allocated on a formation when it contains light vehicles as well as infantry or armoured vehicles?
: The hits must be allocated so that none are wasted and each unit has one hit allocated to it before being allocated a second, or third, etc. if possible.
: In other words, if light vehicles are with infantry then allocate AT hits to the light vehicles before AP hits. If light vehicles are with armoured vehicles then allocate AP hits to the light vehicle before AT hits. If all three types are in the same formation talk it out with your opponent.

*[AP]: Anti-personnel
*[AT]: Anti-tank
