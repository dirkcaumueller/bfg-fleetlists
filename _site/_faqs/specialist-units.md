name: Specialist Units
---
Can a unit have the same special ability more than once?
: No. Duplicated abilities (from characters being added to the unit, for example) should be treated as occurring once.

Can units being transported use their special abilities?
: Yes.

Can units that are off board use their special abilities.
: No, but there are some exceptions. Special abilities that allow the formation to be placed on the table (_teleport_, _tunneler_, etc) may obviously be used. Also, any special abilities that affect the formation's action or rally test (_farsight_, _supreme commander_, etc.) may be used, but only on the unit's formation. Finally, _leader_ and _slow and steady_ may be used off-board.

Can units that are in a broken formation use their special abilities.
: Yes.
