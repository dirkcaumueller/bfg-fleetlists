A transport unit is destroyed but the units being transported survive and are placed in base contact with an AV, may Macro-weapon hits be allocated to them?
: Yes.

If a unit in an assault with an macro-weapon attack is destroyed by a regular hit before macro-weapon hits are allocated is its macro-weapon attack disguarded?
: No. All attacks in assault are simultaneous, macro-weapon hits are just allocated after regular attacks.
