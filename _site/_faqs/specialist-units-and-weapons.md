name: Specialist Units & Weapons

Some special abilities can apply to both units and weapons. Are there any differences?
: Special abilities on a weapon apply to only to the datasheet line they are on (e.g. Banshee Masks grant _first strike_ to Howling Banshees in close combat and Lictor Talons grant _sniper_ to Lictors in close combat).
: Special weapon abilities on the unit apply to all attacks where applicable (e.g. Warp Spiders have _first strike_ so all their CC and FF attacks have it, as do any extra attacks added from characters), while special unit abilities on the unit do not (e.g. Eldar Rangers have _sniper_ for their shooting attack while their CC and FF attacks do not).
