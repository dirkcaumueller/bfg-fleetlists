name: First Strike
---
A unit in base contact uses a first strike extra attack and the enemy unit is removed. Can the unit still use its CC value for its regular attack?
: Only if it was in base contact with another enemy unit, otherwise it would have to use its FF value.

How does first strike work with supporting fire?
: First strike doesn't provide a benefit in this situation, treat it like normal.
