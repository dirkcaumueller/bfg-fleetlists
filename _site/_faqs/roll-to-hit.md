name: Roll To Hit
---
Can a unit armed with two or more of the same kind of weapon choose to fire some with their AP value and others with their AT value?
: Yes.

Can a unit armed with a weapon with multiple shots choose to fire some shots with the AP value and others with the AT value?
: No. The decision to fire with the AP or AT value is by weapon and for all of its shots.

If a target formation has infantry in cover and armoured vehicles not in cover will my AT to hit rolls suffer the -1 modifier?
: No, and the same holds for the situation in reverse (AV in cover, INF out of cover).

Can I choose to fire some shots at units in cover (taking the -1 to hit modifier) and the rest at units out of cover?
: You may not split each type of fire like this. All AP fire from a shooting formation must take the -1 modifier, or not, at the choice of the player. The same holds for AT and MW fire. However, the player could choose to take the -1 for one type of fire and not to for another.

*[AP]: Anti-personnel
