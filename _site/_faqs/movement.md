Can units move off the gaming table?
: Only if specifically allowed to do so by a special rule.

Can I choose to move a unit 0cm? If so, is it still susceptible to overwatch?
: Yes and yes. Any action that includes one of more moves (advance, engage, double, march and possibly marshal, hold and special actions) is considered a move for the purposes of overwatch, even if units moved 0cm.
: Note that withdrawals are optional however, and that a player can choose not to move a broken formation at all, thus avoiding overwatch.
