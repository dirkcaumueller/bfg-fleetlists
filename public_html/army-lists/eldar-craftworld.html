    <h4>Forces</h4>

    <p>The Iyanden Craftworld Eldar Fleet List uses the datasheets from <a href="#craftworld-eldar-forces">the Craftworld Eldar Forces section</a>.</p>

    <h4>Using The Fleet List</h4>

<p>The fleet list includes the following information:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Class</dt>
  <dd>The type of the ship.</dd>
  <dt>Notes</dt>
  <dd>Notes on usage or optional upgrades.</dd>
  <dt>Cost</dt>
  <dd>The points value of the formation.</dd>
</dl>

    <h4>Special Rules</h4>


<p>The <a href="#eldar-leadership"><em>Eldar Leadership</em></a>, <a href="#eldar-movement"><em>Eldar Movement</em></a>, <a href="#eldar-critical-hits"><em>Eldar Critical Hits</em></a> rules apply to all Eldar vessels. Eldar ships are armed with <em>Eldar Weapons</em> (see <a href="#eldar-weapons"><em>Eldar Weapons</em></a>) and use <em>Eldar Holofields</em> (see <a href="#eldar-holofields"><em>Eldar Holofields</em></a>) for protection rather than shields. Certain ships carry <a href="#aspect-warrior-crews"><em>Aspect Warrior Fighting Crews</em></a>. Iyanden Craftworld ghostships use the <a href="#eldar-ghostships"><em>Ghostships</em></a> special rules.</p>

  <h3 id="eldar-leadership" class="" style="" data-heading=".2.1">Eldar Leadership</h3>

  <div>
<p>All Eldar ships add + 1 to the Leadership score generated on the Leadership table on page 10, giving them a Leadership value between 7 and 10. Due to their unique method of movement, the Eldar may not use the following special orders: All Ahead Full, Burn Retros, Come To New Heading. Note: because Eldar ships cannot use All Ahead Full special orders, they also may not ram.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="special-rule ">
  <h3 id="eldar-movement" class="" style="" data-heading=".2.2">Eldar Movement</h3>

  <div>
<p>The movement rules below replace the normal movement rules for Eldar ships. Assume anything not modified below applies normally to the Eldar.</p>

<p>Eldar ships move in their movement phase and in the ordnance phase of their own tum. Note that they do not move in the ordnance phase of the enemy’s tum. Before an Eldar ship moves, it may tum to face any direction. It always turns before it moves and then remains facing in that direction until the start of its next move. Work out the speed an Eldar ship can move at after it has turned. Its speed depends on its facing towards the sunward table edge.</p>

<p>All Eldar ships have three speeds (for example, 10/20/30). The first is used if the sunward table edge is in the Eldar ship’s front fire arc; the second is used if the sunward table edge is in its rear fire arc; and the third is used if the sunward table edge is in its left or right fire arcs. If the sunward table edge lies on the line between two fire arcs, the Eldar player may choose which he uses.
Eldar ships have no minimum move distances. They move from zero up to the maximum distance allowed by the direction of the sun. After their initial tum they travel in a straight line and may not make additional turns as they move. If under Lock-On special orders, Eldar ships cannot tum for EITHER movement phase.</p>

<p>As noted above, the Eldar move twice in each of their turns. The second move is made in the ordnance phase after any ordnance is moved, but apart from this all the rules described for Eldar movement will apply.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Blast Markers and Gravity Wells</dt>
  <dd>Eldar are affected by Blast markers in the same way as other ships without shields - they will take a point of damage on a D6 roll of 6 and reduce their speed by 5 cm that turn. Eldar have to make a test after each of their two movements in which they encounter blast markers. Gravity wells allow Eldar to curve their normally straight line move around the planet and so the ship may make a free tum towards the planet at the end of its move (since it can tum in any direction at the start, there is no additional benefit at the start of its move).</dd>
  <dt>Boarding</dt>
  <dd>An Eldar vessel intending to board an opponent may do so in either movement phase, but it may not shoot or launch ordnance before doing so. If it boards in its movement phase, it may not make its second movement.</dd>

<p>Any hit on an Eldar ship causes critical damage on a D6 roll of 4+, rather than the usual 6+. Roll 2D6 on the following Eldar Critical Hits table, rather than the standard Critical Hits table.</p>

<div class="special-rule ">
  <h3 id="eldar-holofields" class="" style="" data-heading=".2.4">Eldar Holofields</h3>

  <div>
<p>Against attacks that use the Gunnery table, the holofields cause one column shift to the right, in addition to any other column shifts for range or Blast markers. Against any other form of attack (lances, torpedoes, etc), roll to hit an Eldar ship as normal, but the Eldar player may then make a saving roll for his holofields.</p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <th>D6</th>
      <th>RESULT</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Hit! Score a hit on the Eldar ship.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2+</td>
      <td>Missed! Place a Blast marker in contact with the ship.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that holofields do not negate hits or effects from moving through blast markers, area effects, exploding ships and celestial phenomena. They do, however, work against ordnance hits, hit-and-run raids, boarding actions, ramming or Nova Cannon. When saving against Nova Cannon, it rolls once against the hit itself, not the subsequent D6 damage rolls if the save fails.</p>

<div class="special-rule ">
  <h3 id="eldar-weapons" class="" style="" data-heading=".2.5">Eldar Weapons</h3>

  <div>
<p>Eldar ships carry three main weapon systems which are described below.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Pulsar Lance</dt>
  <dd>Pulsar lances fire volleys of high energy laser bolts. These count as lance shots, and hit on a 4+ no matter what the target’s armour. However, if a pulsar lance shot hits, then you may roll to hit again and you may keep on rolling to hit until you miss or the lance has scored a total of 3 hits.</dd>
  <dt>Shadow Lance</dt>
  <dd>Shadow lances are less powerful laser weapons, and count as typical lances in all respects.</dd>
  <dt>Weapon Batteries</dt>
  <dd>Eldar weapons batteries are short-ranged weapons that unleash a torrent of fire. They employ sophisticated targeting systems which make them very accurate even at extreme angles of attack. To represent their accuracy, Eldar weapons batteries count all targets as ‘closing’ on the Gunnery table, no matter what the target’s actual aspect is. This aside, all the normal rules apply.</dd>
  <dt>Torpedoes</dt>
  <dd>Eldar torpedoes use sophisticated targeter scrambling systems to make themselves virtually undetectable until they strike. To represent this, defensive turrets only hit Eldar torpedoes on a roll of 6, rather than on a roll of 4+ as is normally the case. In addition, the highly accurate targeting sensors on Eldar torpedoes allow you to re-roll the dice to hit for any torpedo that misses a target on the first attempt.</dd>
  <dt>Eldar Attack Craft</dt>
  <dd>Defensive turrets only hit any Eldar attack craft on a roll of 6, rather than on a roll of 4 to 6 as is normally the case. Eldar fighters are <em>resilient</em>: when attacking and removing an enemy ordnance token, Eldar fighters remain in play on a roll of 4+. This may only be used once per turn. Eldar bombers on attack runs may re-roll the dice to determine the number of attacks they make (the second roll stands).</dd>
</dl>

</div>

<div class="special-rule ">
  <h3 id="aspect-warrior-crews" class="" style="" data-heading=".2.6">Aspect Warrior Fighting Crews</h3>

  <div>
<p>Certain ships in an Eldar fleet are permitted to carry Aspect Warrior Fighting Crews as chosen from the fleet list, adding +2 to their dice roll when fighting in a boarding action, or +1 to the dice roll when conducting a hit-and-run attack.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="special-rule ">
  <h3 id="eldar-ghostships" class="" style="" data-heading=".2.7">Eldar Ghostships</h3>

  <div>
<p>Any vessel in an Iyanden fleet may be converted into a Ghostship. Ghostships use the following rules:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Leadership</dt>
  <dd>Ghostships have normal Eldar leadership.</dd>
  <dt>Special Orders</dt>
  <dd>If a Ghostship fails a Command check for a special order, it not only fails to go onto the special order but may also do nothing except move this turn. If the failed check is as a result of attempting to go onto Brace for Impact orders at another point during the turn, the Ghostship may still attempt to Brace for Impact but may do nothing except move during its next turn instead. When you fail a Command check for a Ghostship you may not make any further Command checks for other Ghostships during the same turn. You may, however, continue to give special orders to other “crewed” vessels in the fleet (until, of course, you fail a Command check with one of them as well).</dd>
  <dt>Deathless</dt>
  <dd>By the normal fragile standards of the Eldar, Ghostships present a fairly sturdy proposition. Ghostships, unlike other Eldar vessels, only suffer a critical hit on a roll of a 6 (not a 4, 5 or 6 as is usually the case with Eldar vessels).</dd>
  <dt>Uncrewed</dt>
  <dd>Since Ghostships are piloted by the spirits of long-dead Eldar warriors, their crews are either small or non-existent. For this reason:
    <ul>
      <li>Ghostships may not contain Aspect Warrior fighting crews.</li>
      <li>Ghostships may not be armed with launch bays.</li>
      <li>Ghostships may not initiate boarding actions or hit-and-run attacks of any form.</li>
      <li>Enemies boarding a Ghostship gain a +1 modifier in the boarding action, in addition to other modifiers.</li>
      <li>Enemies making a hit-and-run attack against Ghostships add +1 to their dice roll.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Ghostships roll only half the normal number of dice when undertaking damage control in the End phase (before halving it again for Blast markers, if appropriate).</p>
